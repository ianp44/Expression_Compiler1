All the Javascript and associated HTML pages for my demo expression compiler Beta Version 4.0

These are all the Javascript and HTML files that make an expression compiler
which can pars a near Javascript expression in x() to a pars tree and then intermediate code
and then run it using a simple intermediate code interpreter to graph the equation.
The user interface allows you to choose the text for the equation from options and
then easily compile and run it. You can edit the expression and recompile.
Once only expressions which are not for graphing can also be typed in a compiled and run.
There are currently some bugs in this version, namely operators of equal priority 
associate right to left not left to right. String functions will pars but won't
run properly. There is no arity checking, and there is some kind of parsing bug.

There is associated help and glossary, which is not complete.

The main motive for putting up this Beta version is to register it for copyright reasons.

Ian Pouncy.
